### emilyy's cydia repo template

 **Repository Structure:**
   ```
   /debs/
   /CydiaIcon.png
   /Packages
   /Packages.bz2
   /Packages.gz
   /Release
   ```

**How can I use this?**<br>
I recommend using a linux server with either nginx or apache2 (depends on your preference). You can also use cloudflare pages but that may be an annoying process.

**What comes with it?**<br>
It comes with the neofetch package and a script to keep the repo up to date. It also includes a simple page to add your repo which can run on most (if not all) Safari versions.
